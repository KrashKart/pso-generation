# pso-generation
This code was written for my research internship on an inverse feature-generation problem for the Water-Gas shift reaction.

This implementation (heavily based on [pyswarms](https://pypi.org/project/pyswarms/)) involves using Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) to search for a global minimum and generate inputs for the shift reaction to maximise yield.
